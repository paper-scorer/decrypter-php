This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PaperScorer Decrypter (PHP) — a zero-dependency PHP library for decrypting encrypted payloads returned from the PaperScorer engine. Requires PHP >= 7.4 with the `openssl` extension.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (includes PHPUnit as a dev dependency)
composer install

# Run all tests
vendor/bin/phpunit

# Run a single test by method name
vendor/bin/phpunit --filter testDecryptReturnsExpectedPlaintext
```

## Architecture

The entire library is a single class: `src/Decrypter.php` in namespace `PaperScorer\DecrypterPhp`.

**Decryption protocol:**
- Input is a base64-encoded string with three concatenated segments:
  - Bytes 0–24: IV (base64-encoded, decodes to 16 bytes)
  - Bytes 24–52: Salt (base64-encoded, decodes to 21 bytes)
  - Bytes 52+: Ciphertext (base64-encoded)
- Key derivation: `substr(sha256(decryptKey + decodedSalt), 0, 16)`
- Cipher: AES-128-CBC via `openssl_decrypt` with `OPENSSL_RAW_DATA`
- Output: decrypted JSON string
